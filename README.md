# BRIEF


<!-- origin="file:///./source/typescript/cli.ts#L1-L13" -->


 **cfw.Docs** is a documentation generator for CandleFW libraries. It is used to
 create the README, CONTRIBUTION, and CODE_OF_CONDUCT and API documentation for
 all CandleFW repositories, and also serves as the central repository for the
 CandleFW hosted documentation.

 Docs runs as a stand alone application that can process documentation for individual
 CandleFW libraries or build documentation for all libraries at once. It can also be used
 to build a documentation site outside the repo for personal use. Additionally, any
 repo based on Typescript or Javascript that follows the *CFW Repo Organization Pattern*
 can take advantage of cfw.Docs to auto-generate documentation.

## CFW Repository Organization Pattern
CandleFW repositories follow a few patterns for organizing files and settings of configuration files:
- Source files are stored in ```repo_root/source/```
- TypeScript source files are stored in ```repo_root/source/typescript/```
- Hydrocarbon Grammar files ```*.hcg``` are stored in ```repo_root/source/grammar/```
- Documentation fragments are stored in the directory ```repo_root/source/doc_fragments/``` or any
subdirectory within
`tsconfig.json` files are configured with, but not limited to, the following settings:
```json
{
    "compileOnSave": true,
    "include": [ "./source/typescript/** /*"  ],
    "compilerOptions": {
        "baseUrl": "./",
        "module": "ESNext",
        "outDir": "./build/library",
        "declarationDir": "./build/types",
        "declaration": true,
        "skipLibCheck": true
    }
}
```
`package.json` files are configured with, but not limited to, the following settings:
```json
{
    "version": "Version will appear in readme and api.",
    "description": "Description will appear in the readme",
}
```

## Document Fragments
Document fragments are section of text data within Markdown files and in *JavaScript* / *TypeScript* block comments that provide the content for documentation generated by Docs.
Preamble sections defined in each fragment specify where that fragment should go within the generated documentation. Docs will automatically locate these fragments and combine them to generate README, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, and CONTRIBUTORS markdown files as well as API website files.
### Usage
There are two places a document fragment can be defined in:
- A JavaScript / TypeScript comment block `/* ... */`
- A markdown file within the `repo_root/source/doc_fragments` directory or subdirectories
Multiple fragments can be defined within a Markdown file, but only one fragment can be defined per comment block.
#### JavaScript
A JavaScript block comment document fragment looks like this:
```js
/** [API]:introduction
 * ### JavaScript Comment Block Syntax
 * This is an example of a comment block. The [API]:introduction 
 * text at the top signals to Docs that this fragment should end 
 * up in the API documentation as part of the Introduction section.
 */

```
The second `*` asterick is important, as it signals that the block is to be
considered fragment candidate. Any leading `*` on subsequent lines will be
stripped from the fragment.
#### Markdown
Markdown files in `repo_root/source/doc_fragments/**/*` can have document fragments defined as so:
```markdown
<!-- [API;README]:introduction -->
### Markdown Syntax
The HTML comment above indicates this document fragment is to be used
in both the API documentation as well as the README.md file in the 
**Introduction** section. 

<!-- [API;README]:miscellaneous -->
Additional fragments can be defined by adding more HTML comments to signal
the start of a new fragment
```
### Syntax
The full grammar is defined in [doc_fragment.hcg](source/grammar/doc_fragment.hcg) and [comment.hcg](source/grammar/comment.hcg)
#### Javascript:
>**/\*\*** `FRAGMENT_PREAMBLE` `FRAGMENT_MARKDOWN_CONTENT` **\*/**
#### Markdown File:
>**<\!--** `FRAGMENT_PREAMBLE` **-->**
>
>`FRAGMENT_MARKDOWN_CONTENT`
### `FRAGMENT_MARKDOWN_CONTENT`:
Any text data including Markdown and HTML data.
### `FRAGMENT_PREAMBLE`:
>  **[** `DOC_TYPE` *[* **;** `DOC_TYPE`*]* * **]** *(* **:** `USAGE_SPECIFIER` *)?*
### `DOC_TYPE`:
Any one of the following :
- API
- README
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT
- CONTRIBUTORS
TODO - Refine syntax to allow custom organization and arrangement of fragments.

# CFW DEPENDENCIES

As a part of CandleFW, cfw.docs relies on the following libraries to make the magic happen. 
The modular design of CFW allows each on to be used independently for specific project needs. 
Give them a look to find out more.

## Generating Readme Documentation
`README.md` files are generated from [*document fragment*](#document_fragment) comments
found within the packages main source file, and HTML document fragments found within
Markdown files in the `repo_root/source/doc_fragments`  directory and subdirectory.
**cfw.Doc** keeps track of the source of each fragment and will generate an icon
<img src="source/brand/go_to_source.svg" height="15" alt="go_to_fragment_source_icon">
that will link to the original source file. This can be found at the bottom-right of
the fragment contents.
