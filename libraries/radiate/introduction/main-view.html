		<h1 id="intro"> Introduction to cfw.Radiate </h1>
		
		radiate use classic HTML folder based layouts to create webpages. Mainly becuase this how web works, accessing directories from a host. Unless we the way websites are linked is changed, there is no need to subsverte the natural order. 

		Radiate builds on wick by providing routing. It introduces a couple elements.

		<p>
			APP - Radiate needs this to build the application. It is the entry point for all radiate does. Can be a modal.
		</p> 

		<p>
			Element - Should be a major area of the app, such as a nav bar, content area, etc.
		</p>

		<p>
			Component - a single component mount point within an element. ID'd by either ID element, or a url attribute. URLs are resolved automatically. 
		</p>
