		Scope is the heart and soul of a wick component. It defines data flow boundaries and provides mechanisms to integrate scripts and CSS code into a scoped set of elements. Every component that wick generates has a scope assigned to it's root element. 

		<example>
			<scope>This element is scoped</scope>
		</example>

		<example>
			<scope element="a" href="#">This element is scoped</scope>
		</example>

		attributes 
			export 
			import
			element
			component

		<h1 id=container> Container </h1>

		<h3>Transitions</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>trs_asc_in | scope is transitioning into view, from a lower index position into a higher index. i.e in from the top of the screen</li>
			<li>trs_asc_out | scope is transitioning out of the view, from a lower index position into a higher index. i.e. out through the bottom of the screen</li>
			<li>trs_dec_in | scope is transitioning into view, from a higher index position into a lower index. i.e. in form the bottom of the screen</li>
			<li>trs_dec_out | scope is transitioning out of the view, from a higher index position into a lower index. i.e. out through the top of the screen</li>
