It can also be used \n * to build a documentation site outside the repo for personal use. Additionally, any \n * repo based on Typescript or Javascript that follows the *CFW Repo Organization Pattern* \n * can take advantage of cfw.Docs to auto-generate documentation.\n */\n\n\nimport { getProcessArgs, xtF, xtColor, xtReset, col_x11, xtBold } from \"@candlefw/wax\";\n"]}
